# 🔒 BRANDY-SHOP Security Guidelines

## 🛡️ Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in BRANDY-SHOP and guidelines for maintaining security standards.

## 🔐 Environment Variables Security

### ✅ **Secure Environment Variables**
All sensitive data is stored in environment variables and never committed to the repository:

```bash
# ✅ SECURE - These are safe to expose to client-side
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xrqfckeuzzgnwkutxqkx.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
VITE_APP_NAME=BRANDY-SHOP
VITE_APP_URL=https://brandyshop.netlify.app

# ⚠️ SENSITIVE - Keep these secure
VITE_INSTAPAY_API_KEY=your_production_key
VITE_DEEPAI_API_KEY=your_deepai_key
```

### 🚫 **Never Commit These Files**
- `.env`
- `.env.local`
- `.env.production`
- Any file containing API keys or secrets

## 🗄️ Database Security

### ✅ **Row Level Security (RLS)**
All tables have RLS policies enabled:

```sql
-- Users can only access their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Artists can only manage their own products
CREATE POLICY "Artists can manage own products" ON products
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = artist_id);

-- Customers can only see their own orders
CREATE POLICY "Customers can view own orders" ON orders
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = customer_id);
```

### ✅ **Secure Database Access**
- Supabase anon key is safe for client-side use
- Service role key is never exposed to client
- All database operations go through RLS policies

## 🔑 Authentication Security

### ✅ **JWT Token Security**
- Tokens are automatically managed by Supabase
- Secure HTTP-only cookies (when possible)
- Automatic token refresh
- Proper session management

### ✅ **Password Security**
- Minimum 6 characters required
- Handled entirely by Supabase Auth
- No passwords stored in our database
- Email verification required

### ✅ **Role-Based Access Control**
```typescript
// Route protection by role
<AdminRoute>  // Only admin users
<ArtistRoute> // Only artist users
<AuthenticatedRoute> // Any authenticated user
```

## 🌐 API Security

### ✅ **External API Security**
- API keys stored in environment variables
- Rate limiting implemented where possible
- Error handling prevents information leakage

### ✅ **CORS Configuration**
- Proper CORS headers set via Netlify
- Restricted to production domains
- No wildcard origins in production

## 🔒 Frontend Security

### ✅ **XSS Prevention**
- React's built-in XSS protection
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage
- Input sanitization for user content

### ✅ **Content Security Policy**
```toml
# netlify.toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
```

### ✅ **Secure Headers**
- HTTPS enforced
- Secure cookies
- HSTS headers
- No sensitive data in localStorage

## 📦 Dependency Security

### ✅ **Package Security**
```bash
# Regular security audits
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Keep dependencies updated
npm update
```

### ✅ **Trusted Dependencies**
- Only use well-maintained packages
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability monitoring

## 🚀 Deployment Security

- HTTPS enforced
- Environment variables secured
- Build logs don't expose secrets
- Proper redirect rules

### ✅ **Git Security**
- No secrets in commit history
- Proper .gitignore configuration
- Signed commits (recommended)

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### ✅ **Error Handling**
