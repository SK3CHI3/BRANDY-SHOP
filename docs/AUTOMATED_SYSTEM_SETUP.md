# 🤖 Automated Withdrawal System - Setup Guide

## Quick Setup for Production

### 1. Database Migration ✅ (Already Completed)
The database has been migrated with all necessary tables, triggers, and functions.

### 2. Environment Variables
Add these to your production environment:

```env
# InstaPay Configuration
INSTAPAY_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
INSTAPAY_BASE_URL=https://api.instapay.co.ke
INSTAPAY_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Automated System Settings
MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT=1000
WITHDRAWAL_HOLD_DAYS=7
PLATFORM_FEE_RATE=0.05
EARNINGS_MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL=3600

# Security (Optional)
MAINTENANCE_API_KEY=your_secure_api_key_for_cron_jobs
```

### 3. Cron Job Setup (Critical)
Set up automated maintenance to run every hour:

#### Option A: Server Cron
```bash
# Add to your server's crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs every hour)
0 * * * * curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/earnings/maintenance
```

#### Option B: Vercel Cron (Recommended)
Create `vercel.json` in your project root:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/earnings/maintenance",
      "schedule": "0 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Option C: External Cron Service
Use services like:
- **Cron-job.org** (Free)
- **EasyCron** (Paid)
- **AWS CloudWatch Events**

### 4. API Endpoints Available

#### Maintenance Endpoint
```
POST /api/earnings/maintenance
```
- Automatically updates pending earnings to available
- Should be called every hour
- Returns statistics about processed earnings

#### Statistics Endpoint
```
GET /api/earnings/statistics
GET /api/earnings/statistics?include_activity=true&limit=10
```
- Real-time system health metrics
- Optional recent activity data

### 5. System Verification

#### Test the Complete Flow
1. **Create Test Order**:
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total_amount, payment_status) 
   VALUES ('customer-id', 2500.00, 'pending');
   ```

2. **Complete Payment** (triggers automatic earnings):
   ```sql
   UPDATE orders SET payment_status = 'paid' WHERE id = 'order-id';
   ```

3. **Verify Earnings Created**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM artist_earnings WHERE order_id = 'order-id';
   ```

4. **Test Maintenance**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/earnings/maintenance
   ```

5. **Check Statistics**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/earnings/statistics
   ```

### 6. Monitoring Setup

#### Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /api/earnings/statistics` - System health
- `POST /api/earnings/maintenance` - Manual maintenance trigger

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Pending earnings count
- Failed maintenance executions
- M-Pesa payment failures
- Database trigger performance

#### Alerts to Set Up
1. **Cron Job Failures** - If maintenance doesn't run for 2+ hours
2. **High Pending Count** - If >100 earnings stuck in pending
3. **Payment Failures** - If M-Pesa success rate <95%
4. **Database Errors** - Any trigger or function failures

### 7. Security Considerations

#### API Key Protection
```typescript
// In your maintenance endpoint
const apiKey = req.headers['x-api-key']
if (apiKey !== process.env.MAINTENANCE_API_KEY) {
  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
}
```

#### Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting on maintenance endpoint to prevent abuse.

#### Database Security
- RLS policies are already in place
- Artists can only see their own data
- Admins have full access

### 8. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
1. **Earnings not created**: Check if trigger is active
2. **Maintenance not running**: Verify cron job setup
3. **M-Pesa failures**: Check API credentials and network

#### Debug Commands
```sql
-- Check trigger status
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE '%earnings%';

-- Check recent maintenance
SELECT * FROM maintenance_log ORDER BY executed_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- System health check
SELECT * FROM get_earnings_statistics();
```

### 9. Performance Optimization

#### Database Indexes
All necessary indexes are already created for optimal performance.

#### Caching Strategy
Consider implementing Redis caching for:
- Withdrawal summaries
- System statistics
- Recent activity data

#### Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Monitor system performance
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_earnings,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'pending') as pending,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'available') as available,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at))/3600) as avg_age_hours
FROM artist_earnings;
```

## 🎉 System Status: PRODUCTION READY

✅ **Database**: Fully migrated with triggers and functions  
✅ **API Endpoints**: Created and tested  
✅ **Automation**: 99% automated (only admin approval manual)  
✅ **Security**: RLS policies and validation in place  
✅ **Monitoring**: Real-time statistics and health checks  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides available  

**Next Step**: Set up the cron job and start processing real transactions! 🚀
